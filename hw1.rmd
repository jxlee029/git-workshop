This is the website for ***“R for Data Science”***. This book will teach you how to do **data science** with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. *These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R.* You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to `facilitate discoveries` when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.
